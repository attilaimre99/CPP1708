# Cell Penetrating Peptides datasets
List of peptides in a FASTA format with their cell penetrating ability. 

* benchmark.csv - Training data.
* independent.csv - Independent validation data.
* uptake.csv - Contains data about the uptake potential, eg. slow or fast.

## Testing datasets
* CyclicPep.zip - CyclicPep data
* ModPep.zip - Peptides with modified residues
